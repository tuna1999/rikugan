"""Theme binding helper for Rikugan widgets.

The previous design relied on every widget subclass remembering to
write the same boilerplate::

    self._apply_styles()
    ThemeManager.instance().themeChanged.connect(self._apply_styles)

…and to mirror the disconnects in ``shutdown()`` / ``closeEvent()``
to keep panel teardown from printing Shiboken ``RuntimeWarning``
``Failed to disconnect`` messages.  The helper centralises both sides
of that contract so widget code only declares *what* should run on a
theme change, not *how* it gets wired to the singleton.

Usage::

    from .theme.applicator import bind_theme, disconnect_theme

    class MyWidget(QWidget):
        def __init__(self, parent=None):
            super().__init__(parent)
            ...
            # Run ``self._apply_styles()`` now, and again on every
            # ``themeChanged`` emit.
            bind_theme(self, self._apply_styles)

        def shutdown(self) -> None:
            # Idempotent: tolerates teardown races.
            disconnect_theme(self)

Implementation notes
-------------------
* The connected callable is stashed on the widget as
  ``widget._theme_apply_callback`` so it cannot be garbage-collected
  out from under Qt (the previous inline pattern stored a bound method
  reference too, but adding the attribute makes the lookup uniform
  for ``disconnect_theme`` and survives PySide6's ``connect`` slot
  caching).
* Apply callbacks must accept the emitted tokens argument. Qt's
  ``Signal`` always passes one positional argument even when the
  signal is declared with no parameters, so widget methods that
  take no args will miscount.  The helper detects zero-arg callables
  and wraps them so they continue to work without forcing every
  caller to remember the underscore-prefix convention.
* Disconnect swallows the same disconnect-time errors that
  ``panel_core.shutdown`` swallows (``RuntimeError``, ``TypeError``,
  ``SystemError``, ``ImportError``) and silences the ``RuntimeWarning``
  PySide6 emits when the slot was never connected.
