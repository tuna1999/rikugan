"""Rikugan early-startup crash log.

This module is loaded by ``rikugan_plugin.py`` at IDA plugin import time,
*before* anything that might crash (Shiboken's ``__import__`` hook,
``qt_compat._detect_binding()``, ``FormToPySideWidget``).

**Stdlib only.** No ``import rikugan.*`` — avoids circular imports and
prevents us from pulling in code that might itself be the crash site. If
Qt is broken, IDA's Python is broken, or our own logging subsystem is
unreachable, this module still writes a self-contained forensic log to
``~/.idapro/rikugan/early_startup.log``.

Public surface:

- :func:`_early_log` — append a single record (``msg``, ``level``).
- :func:`_early_log_crash` — flush the in-memory ring buffer + a formatted
  traceback into a sibling ``early_startup_crash.log``.
- :func:`_early_log_path` — full path to the running log (tests + inspection).
- :func:`_early_log_crash_path` — full path to the crash log.
- :func:`_early_log_buffer_snapshot` — in-memory ring buffer (tests).
- :func:`_reset_for_tests` — drop state and close the file handle (tests).

Behavior:

- One file per process; opened in append+text mode at import time.
- Every record is followed by ``flush()`` + ``os.fsync()`` so the previous
  records survive a hard crash that hits the next call.
- All operations swallow their own exceptions; we are a diagnostic sink
  and must never crash the host.
