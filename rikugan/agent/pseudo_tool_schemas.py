"""Static JSON schemas for Rikugan's pseudo-tools.

These schemas are passed to LLM providers to describe pseudo-tool calls
(``exploration_report``, ``phase_transition``, ``save_memory``,
``spawn_subagent``, ``research_note``, ``ask_user``,
``delegate_external_task``) that the agent loop handles internally
rather than forwarding to the user-supplied tool registry.

All schemas are module-level constants because they do not depend on
runtime state — they are pure data describing the contract between the
LLM and the agent loop.  Putting them in their own module keeps
``loop.py`` focused on control flow and makes it trivial for new agent
modes to reuse the exact same tool surface.

This is the single source of truth for pseudo-tool descriptions: the
``function.description`` strings here are part of the LLM prompt, so
changing them changes model behaviour.  ``loop.py`` imports these
constants rather than redefining them inline.
