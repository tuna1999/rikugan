"""End-to-end tests for SubprocessBridge.

The existing ``test_subprocess_bridge.py`` covers the security
guards (``_build_command`` argv injection defense) but does NOT
actually spawn a subprocess. These tests close that gap by
invoking the real ``python -c`` binary as a stand-in for
``claude`` / ``codex`` and verifying the full event stream
(stdout, completed, cancel) end-to-end.

Why use ``sys.executable`` as the test "agent": it ships
with every Python install, doesn't depend on PATH
auto-discovery, and produces deterministic output we can
assert on.
